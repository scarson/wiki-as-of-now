# Performance Audit

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC 2119] [RFC 8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Overview

Running a critical performance review of the project.

Focus: **$ARGUMENTS** (default: full review across all applicable dimensions)

This skill detects the stack and version, builds (or reuses) version-specific performance guidance, dispatches independent performance lanes in parallel, and synthesizes a ranked, calibrated report. It is independently invocable as a **snapshot** (no remediation). For the full audit→verify→decide→remediate loop, use the sibling `performance-audit-cycle`.

Companion references (read as needed, one level deep):
- [`finding-model.md`](finding-model.md) — how findings are scored, calibration, the disposition discipline.
- [`currency-protocol.md`](currency-protocol.md) — version-aware currency-brief research + cache.
- [`lane-prompts.md`](lane-prompts.md) — the verbatim dispatch prompts for every lane.
- [`profile-packs/`](profile-packs/) — per-ecosystem lane lenses (`generic-pack.md` is the always-loaded fallback).
- [`run-schema.md`](run-schema.md) — versioned run metadata + ledger + finding fingerprints for historical/regression analysis.
- [`version-indexes/`](version-indexes/) — shipped, build-once "API/feature → version → perf benefit" lookups; the `idiom-currency` lane consults these before any live research.

## Philosophy

This is an adversarial review. Each lane agent's job is to find performance problems in its dimension — not to praise what's working.

**Anti-sycophancy rules for all lanes:**
- Lanes MUST NOT open with "performance is generally fine" or soften findings.
- Lanes MUST NOT give scores or grades — just report problems (with impact).
- Lanes MUST NOT pad with cold-path micro-nits. Calibration (`finding-model.md`) governs what to generate; without it, lanes pad.
- If a lane genuinely finds nothing significant, it MUST say "No significant findings" and explain in one sentence what it examined.

**Exception — the Execution Cost Map (`cost-map`) lane is descriptive, not adversarial.** It produces a map of likely time-concentration, not a problem list, and MUST NOT manufacture problems to fill it.

## Phase 0 — Stack & version detection

Detect languages, frameworks, **and exact versions** from manifests:

| Manifest | Ecosystem / signals |
|---|---|
| `package.json` + lockfile | Node/JS/TS; React/Angular/Vue/Next versions |
| `pyproject.toml` / `requirements*.txt` / `poetry.lock` | Python; Django/Flask/FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/pandas |
| `go.mod` | Go + module versions |
| `Cargo.toml` / `Cargo.lock` | Rust + crate versions |
| `*.csproj` / `packages.config` / `Directory.Packages.props` | .NET — **modern** (TFM `net8.0`+, `<PackageReference>`) vs **Framework** (TFM `net4x`, `packages.config`) |
| `pom.xml` / `build.gradle(.kts)` | JVM (Java/Kotlin); Spring/Hibernate |
| `Package.swift` / `*.xcodeproj` / `*.xcworkspace` / `Podfile` | Swift; SwiftUI/UIKit, Core Data/SwiftData, SwiftPM/Vapor |
| `Gemfile.lock` / `composer.lock` | (generic fallback) |
| Hand-written SQL — `*.sql`, migration/stored-proc files, embedded query strings, schema DDL | **SQL companion pack** (loads *alongside* the language pack) + dialect: PostgreSQL vs T-SQL/SQL Server |
| HTML documents — `*.html`/`*.htm`, server templates (`*.erb`/`*.jinja`/`*.twig`/`*.blade.php`/`*.cshtml`/`*.njk`), static-site output, `<!DOCTYPE html>` markup | **HTML companion pack** (loads *alongside* the backend that emits the markup) + modules: images-media, fonts |

**The SQL companion pack** (`sql.md`) is **content-detected, not manifest-detected**: load it in addition to the application's language pack whenever hand-written SQL (not just ORM calls) is *material* to the scope — raw queries, views, stored procedures, functions, triggers, or migrations — and load the matching dialect module (`sql/postgres.md` or `sql/tsql.md`) from the database driver/DSN or dialect syntax. The SQL pack reasons best when the **schema/DDL is in scope** (indexes, types, keys); note reduced confidence when it is not. ORM-generated SQL is covered by the language packs' data modules instead. **Follow routine invocations into their definitions:** an `EXEC`/`CALL`/proc-name reference (or DML on a triggered table) in the application code points at hand-rolled SQL whose body lives in a schema/migration file — pull those routine/trigger definitions into scope and audit their bodies, or the most expensive hand-rolled SQL stays invisible (see `sql.md` "Routines").

**The HTML companion pack** (`html.md`) is likewise **content-detected**: load it *alongside* the backend pack whenever rendered HTML markup (static, server-templated, or a JS framework's HTML output) is material to the scope — it owns the **document/rendering/delivery** layer (critical rendering path, render-blocking resources, DOM size, compression/caching, Core Web Vitals) that exists even with little or no JavaScript. Load `html/images-media.md` when the page carries significant imagery/embeds and `html/fonts.md` when it uses web fonts. The **JS bundle** itself (tree-shaking, code-splitting, transpile target) stays with the JS/TS `bundling-build` module — `html.md` is the markup/delivery layer, not the bundler.

**Detection is scoped to the audit scope, not the whole repo.** In a monorepo the root manifest can misrepresent the area under audit — the runner walks up from the scoped files to the nearest governing manifest(s) and profiles *those*. A `full` audit profiles all of them.

Output a **stack profile** (`{ecosystem, framework, version}` tuples + source layout). It selects which profile pack(s) to load and seeds the currency brief. If detection is ambiguous or polyglot, load every matching pack plus `generic-pack.md` and note reduced specificity for unmatched parts.

**Sub-stack modules:** if a matched pack carries a `## Framework / sub-stack modules (load on detection)` map (`dotnet.md`, `go.md`, `python.md`, `javascript-typescript.md`, and `rust.md` all do), load the **core** pack for the project plus only the `<ecosystem>/<module>.md` files whose detection signals appear in the audit scope (e.g. load `dotnet/sql-server-data.md` only when EF/`SqlClient`/Dapper is present; `go/grpc.md` only when `google.golang.org/grpc`/`.proto` is present; `python/orm-database.md` only when Django ORM/SQLAlchemy/psycopg is present; `javascript-typescript/react.md` only when React/JSX is present; `rust/web.md` only when axum/actix-web/hyper is present, `rust/data-parallelism.md` only when rayon/polars is present). This keeps each run pasting only the relevant tech lenses, not the whole pack. Load a module when its technology is **material to the audit scope**, not on an incidental or transitive import — a lone `import json` / `import asyncio` (Python) or a stray `encoding/json` (Go) that is peripheral to the scoped code does not by itself warrant the serialization or async module; load it when that technology is *central* to the code under audit (the scope is serialization-heavy, or built on asyncio). Detection selects *candidates*; materiality decides the load.

---

## Phase 1 — Currency brief (anti-stale-training)

Follow [`currency-protocol.md`](currency-protocol.md). In brief, per detected framework:

0. **Shipped version index first (no network):** if `version-indexes/<ecosystem>.md` exists, it covers version-specific perf knowledge up to its `covered_through`; the live steps below only extend past that. This keeps version-history mining a build-once cost, not a per-run one.
1. **Cheap, best-effort** registry check (1-day TTL) for the latest published version. Failure fails *soft* — never blocks the audit.
2. **Reuse** the cached brief at `docs/perf-audits/cache/<ecosystem>/<framework>@<major.minor>.md` if the in-use version matches, no newer version has appeared, and the 180-day fallback hasn't elapsed.
3. Otherwise **refresh** via live web research and rewrite the cache (with sources).
4. **Offline** → emit "currency brief unavailable"; `idiom-currency` findings are LOW confidence; never fabricate version-specific claims.

The brief is passed to every lane. The consolidated report MUST record which brief (and its `researched_on` date) it used.

---

## Phase 2 — Parallel lane dispatch

The runner MUST dispatch the lanes as **independent, concurrent agents** (embarrassingly parallel — they share no mutable state; packs and the brief are read-only inputs). Read [`lane-prompts.md`](lane-prompts.md) and, for each lane, paste the shared preamble + that lane's body, filling placeholders with the scope, the matched profile-pack slice for that lane — the lane-keyed section of the core pack, **plus the core pack's cross-cutting Runtime/Variant-notes section** (and any companion pack's equivalent — SQL's *Reading the plan & schema*, HTML's *Rendering path & Core Web Vitals*), which is shared context that applies to every lane, **plus** any loaded sub-stack modules relevant to the lane, per Phase 0 — the currency brief, and the output file path. Each agent MUST write its raw report to `docs/perf-audits/` **immediately** on completion (persist-before-synthesis) and also return findings for consolidation.

### Lanes

| Lane | id | Run? |
|------|----|------|
| Algorithmic complexity & data structures | `algorithmic` | always |
| Memory & allocation | `memory` | always |
| Data access & I/O | `data-access` | always |
| Concurrency & parallelization | `concurrency` | always |
| Framework-idiom currency | `idiom-currency` | always (uses brief) |
| Execution Cost Map (a map, not findings) | `cost-map` | always |
| Payload / startup / build | `payload-startup` | conditional — only when the stack has such a surface (frontend / serverless / CLI / mobile) |
| Dynamic profiling & benchmarking | `dynamic` | optional — only when the env can build+run AND a real workload exists/can be defensibly built (never invent load) |

The six core lanes (`algorithmic`, `memory`, `data-access`, `concurrency`, `idiom-currency`, `cost-map`) always run. The runner MUST decide `payload-startup` and `dynamic` from the stack profile and environment, and MUST state in the report which lanes ran and why any were skipped. **Refer to lanes by these names, never by bare number** — "Lane 4" is meaningless outside this skill (see Rules).

### Agent model selection

Each subagent SHOULD be invoked using the **latest available Claude Opus model** or **GPT-5 (or successor) at x-high reasoning effort**, unless the user has explicitly instructed otherwise for this run. Performance analysis benefits asymmetrically from maximum reasoning bandwidth, and saving model cost trades poorly against missed regressions that ship to production. If the framework requires a model parameter on dispatch, set it; if it inherits the parent's model, ensure the parent is on the strongest tier before dispatching.

The runner MUST wait for all dispatched lanes to complete before Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3 — Synthesis

After all lanes complete, compile one consolidated report:

1. **Deduplicate** across lanes — cross-lane agreement strengthens a finding; note which lanes flagged each.
2. **Rank** by the finding model (`finding-model.md`): Impact × Confidence, Effort sequencing within bands.
3. **Cross-reference the Execution Cost Map** — a finding on a mapped hot region gets its Impact confirmed; one in cold territory is down-weighted (state, per finding, whether it intersects the map).
4. **Group** cross-cutting root causes.
5. **Measurability note** — note whether the identified hot paths can be *observed* in production (metrics/traces present, or would confirming the win require adding instrumentation first?). Flag findings that can't be measured post-fix.
6. **Merge** every lane's "Suspected Bugs" sections into one Suspected Bugs appendix and, if any exist, **auto-write the bug-hunt kickoff prompt** (below).
7. **Capture run metadata** per [`run-schema.md`](run-schema.md): assign a fingerprint to every finding, emit the versioned frontmatter on the report, append one record to `docs/perf-audits/runs.jsonl`, and compute the regression diff against the most recent prior run for the same scope (new / persisting / resolved). Call out **new** and **resolved** findings in the executive summary — that's the regression signal.

The runner MUST account for every finding from every lane in the consolidated report. The runner MUST NOT drop a surfaced finding as "too minor" — that is the user's call (in the cycle). Calibration governs *generation*, not post-hoc suppression.

### Consolidated report format

Save raw per-lane reports immediately (`docs/perf-audits/<date>T<HH-MM>-<slug>-<lane>.md`), then:

```markdown
---
<run-schema.md frontmatter block — run_schema_version, run_id, date, methodology,
 dispatch (model_requested + reasoning_effort), stack, currency_briefs, lanes_run,
 finding_counts, regression>

> Run bug-hunt-cycle; a ready-to-use kickoff prompt is at

### SB1. <title>
**Location:** <file:line>   **What looks wrong:** …   **Why suspected:** …
```

Consolidated file: `docs/perf-audits/<date>T<HH-MM>-<slug>-consolidated.md`.

### Bug-hunt kickoff prompt (auto-written when suspected bugs exist)

If the Suspected Bugs appendix is non-empty, the runner MUST write `docs/perf-audits/<date>-<slug>-bug-hunt-kickoff.md` containing a paste-ready prompt, and MUST suggest the user run it — but MUST NOT auto-invoke `bug-hunt-cycle`. Template:

```markdown
# Bug-hunt kickoff — suspected bugs from the <date> performance audit

Run: `bug-hunt-cycle` with the scope below.

**Scope:** <the files containing the suspected bugs + one-paragraph context per area>

**Seed findings (verify, don't trust — surfaced incidentally during a perf audit):**
- <SB1 title> — <file:line> — <what looks wrong, why>
- <SB2 …>

These were noticed while auditing performance and were NOT investigated. Treat them
as leads for the hunters, not confirmed bugs.
```

If there are no suspected bugs, write "None" in the appendix and skip the kickoff file.

## Artifacts

- Per-lane raw: `docs/perf-audits/<date>T<HH-MM>-<slug>-<lane>.md`
- Consolidated: `docs/perf-audits/<date>T<HH-MM>-<slug>-consolidated.md` (with versioned frontmatter per `run-schema.md`)
- Run ledger: `docs/perf-audits/runs.jsonl` (one appended record per run — the regression/trend substrate)
- Bug-hunt kickoff (if any): `docs/perf-audits/<date>-<slug>-bug-hunt-kickoff.md`
- Currency cache: `docs/perf-audits/cache/<ecosystem>/<framework>@<major.minor>.md`

The runner MUST save each raw lane report as soon as that lane completes — MUST NOT wait for synthesis — so analysis survives interruption.

---

## Rules

- Lanes MUST read **actual source code**, not just `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`.
- Findings MUST be **actionable** and carry the full finding model (Impact/Confidence/Effort/Verification).
- Effort MUST be expressed as work magnitude, never wall-clock (see `finding-model.md`).
- The runner MUST dispatch all applicable lanes; dropping lanes breaks the independence primitive that makes the review work.
- The runner MUST NOT inflate minors to look thorough, nor downgrade criticals to avoid alarm.
- Correctness bugs are recorded and handed off, never chased here.
- **Write for readers without your context.** Lane names and finding IDs (`P1`, fingerprints) are internal scaffolding. In any outward-facing text — commit messages, PR titles/bodies, code comments, remediation-plan task titles, questions to the user — describe the finding in self-contained terms (what / where / why); never use a bare lane name/number or ID as the sole referent ("addresses the `concurrency` lane" / "fixes P3" is meaningless to others). The ID may be appended as a traceability suffix only. See `finding-model.md` "Referring to findings".
